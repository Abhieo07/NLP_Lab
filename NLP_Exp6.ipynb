        "It contains 500 samples of English-language text, totaling roughly one million words, compiled from works published in the United States in 1961. The tagged Brown Corpus was formed later and used a selection of about 80 parts of speech, as well as special indicators for compound forms, contractions, foreign words and a few other phenomena, and formed the basis for many later corpora."
